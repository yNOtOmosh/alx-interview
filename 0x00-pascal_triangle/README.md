Pascals triangle or Pascal's triangle is an arrangement of binomial coefficients in triangular form. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. The numbers in Pascal's triangle are placed in such a way that each number is the sum of two numbers just above the number. Pascals triangle is used widely in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra.

Generally, we can use Pascal's triangle to find the coefficients of binomial expansion, to find the probability of heads and tails in a toss, in combinations of certain things, etc. Let us discuss Pascals triangle in detail in the following section.

What is Pascal's Triangle?
A pascal's triangle is an arrangement of numbers in a triangular array such that the numbers at the end of each row are 1 and the remaining numbers are the sum of the nearest two numbers in the above row. This concept is used widely in probability, combinatorics, and algebra. Pascal's triangle is used to find the likelihood of the outcome of the toss of a coin, coefficients of binomial expansions in probability, etc.
